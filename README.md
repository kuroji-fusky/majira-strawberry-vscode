Are you a programmer who is also an absolute **furry trash**? ...well, **ME TOO!**

This is basically a carbon copy of the [SynthWave '84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode)
theme but with a hint of green and red tints lazily thrown here and there, it's not creative at all - but I tried!
This is probably one of these things that I've taken one of my two favorite things taken too far and hoping this doesn't get noticed...

## Installation

Installing the theme is very straight forward! You can find it on the [Visual Studio Marketplace][uwu], or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X and
looking up 'majira' in the search box, then click "Install".
