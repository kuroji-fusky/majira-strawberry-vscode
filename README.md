# Majira Strawberry VS Code Theme

*This trash theme is still work in progress, heck, it's not even available yet in the VS Code Marketplace yet.*

Are you a programmer who is also an absolute **furry trash**? ...well, **ME TOO!**

This is basically a carbon copy of the [SynthWave '84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode)
theme but with a hint of green and red tints lazily thrown here and there, it's not creative at all. This is probably one of these things that I've taken one of my two favorite things taken too far and hoping this doesn't get noticed...

## Installation

TBA lol
