## Intro

Are you a programmer? Are you also an absolute **furry trash**? ...well,
**ME TOO!**

It's one of these things that I've taken one of my two favorite things taken
too far and hoping this doesn't get noticed...

This is basically a carbon copy of the [SynthWave '84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode)
theme but with a hint of green and red tints lazily thrown here and there, it's not creative at all.

## Installation

TBA lol
